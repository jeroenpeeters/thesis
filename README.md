## On the journey to continuous deployment: Technical and social challenges along the way
Literature review and case study at Atlassian. Contains summary of challenges faced and mitigation strategies.

 - organisations need to be well prepared to handle technical and social adoption challenges
 - requires proper hardware and software to handle the CD process
 - software developers may feel an increased amount of pressure to have code ready to be deployed immediately
 - lack of understanding / lack of motivation
 - team members have to adapt to different tasks in new roles due to working in a CD environment
 - customers may not notice the newly added features
