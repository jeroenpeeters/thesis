# Introduction

This thesis discusses the software development and delivery approach of a
semi-governmental Software Development Organization. The approach is based on
Agile Continuous Delivery and Deployment principles. These principles allow a
great degree of freedom to individual development teams. The organization
supports the teams with a private computing cloud which enables them to deploy
applications and supporting services as they require. In order to streamline
workflow across teams the development organization prescribes that teams use
tooling that support the Continuous Delivery process.

Since the introduction of a private computing cloud teams are required to
embed more knowledge about Continuous Delivery tooling into the team. This has
led to problems, which are discussed in TODO: insert chapter ref. This has led
to standardization of the tooling needed for an Agile Continuous Delivery approach.

In this thesis I will give an overview of the problems encountered when teams
had complete freedom over their private cloud setup. The problems were collected
from bug reports and interviews with development teams.
Based on these issues standardization was introduced to mitigate some of the problems.
Finally we look how teams perceive the standardization.
